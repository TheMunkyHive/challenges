# Hello World

Thats a great start !
=====================

Lets get the tutorial on the road

Difficulties:

Failed to find explicit information how to authenticate to github.
It took me literally 1 hour to find the solution.

Adding ssh-key authentification

1. Github => Settings => Add SSH Public Key

Learned that github doesnt support 4096 bit rsa keys!
Added the public ecdsa key to githubs website

Trying to figure out pull requests

A long and difficult road lies ahead
